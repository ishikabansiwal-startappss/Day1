    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p>
        I am a B.Tech CSE final year student with a strong passion for Java
        development and building scalable, secure web applications. I have
        hands-on experience with Java, Hibernate, and Spring Boot, specializing
        in backend development with robust frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, crafting
        intuitive and responsive user interfaces. I am also familiar with
        web security principles and microservices architecture, ensuring
        applications are not just functional but also scalable and secure.
